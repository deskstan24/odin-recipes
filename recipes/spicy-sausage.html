    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
      <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin,
        egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands,
        a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized
        balls (about 1 ½-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.
      </li>

        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes.

        about 5 minutes.
